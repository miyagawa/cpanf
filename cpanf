cpanf - Query and install CPAN modules realtime from the fastest (fresh) mirror

  cpanf Module::Name

  # list the recent uploads
  cpanf -l

  cpanf -l Catalyst

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<cpanf> is a command line tool to find, index and download CPAN
modules from fastest mirrors. It would be useful if you want to
install modules before it's mirrored to the mirrors near you which
usually takes a day or two.

Note that "fastest mirror" means the mirror that syncs uploaded
modules from master PAUSE very quickly (almost real-time) and NOT the
nearest mirror that gives you the max download speed.

This tool utilizes FriendFeed CPAN relatime bot
(L<http://friendfeed.com/cpan>) to search and query the updates and
CPAN Testers mirror (L<http://cpan.cpantesters.org/>) to download
modules.

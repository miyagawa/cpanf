NAME
    cpanf - Query and install CPAN modules realtime from the fresh mirror

SYNOPSIS
      # install Module::Name from the fresh mirror
      cpanf Module::Name

DESCRIPTION
    `cpanf' is a command line tool to find, index and download CPAN modules
    from fresh mirrors. It would be useful if you want to install modules
    before it's mirrored to the mirrors near you which usually takes a day
    or two.

    This tool utilizes FriendFeed CPAN relatime bot
    (http://friendfeed.com/cpan) to search and query the updates and CPAN
    Testers mirror (http://cpan.cpantesters.org/) to download modules.
